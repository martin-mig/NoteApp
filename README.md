# Note Application Challenge

The frontend was developed using the [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
The backend was developed using the express template.
The database is MySQL, hosted on Aivencloud, and we use Sequelize to implement the ORM.

## Available Scripts

For running the whole app simply go the directory of the Note Application and run the script

### `run.sh`

or open a terminal in the same directory and run the command

### `./run.sh`

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
If the script is no good, try setting up the modules individualy.
In the frontend directory, you must run:

1: `npm install`
2: `npm start`

In the backend directory, you must run:

1: `npm install`
2: `npm run start`
